## Challenge
The rapid growth of [vgopromo.com](https://www.vgopromo.com), a leading promo codes and e-commerce platform, led to a surge in the volume of database queries. The existing database structure, though effective initially, began to struggle with the increased load, affecting both backend processes and frontend user experience.

## Approach

## Solution
1. **Custom Script**: A tailor-made script was crafted to restructure and optimize the problematic queries, ensuring their efficient execution for [vgopromo.com](https://www.vgopromo.com).
